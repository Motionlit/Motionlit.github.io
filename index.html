                    <p>It is a nice program because it maximize the use of social media which is the number one tool in learning during this pandemic. Through this program you can easily educate people about the importance of Physical Education. Recommendations: 1. You should define first the meaning of dance before going to it's benefits 2. You only focus on the definition of Folk dance ,maybe you should include other genre because some people that may explore your website might not interested in folk dance only.</p>

                    <p>Overall the website is well designed and an educational site. The design of the Web site is appealing to the eye. The layout is good and easy to navigate.(feedback & recommendation base on your field of expertise which is PE teaching : put more information and details for every topics, I prefer a carousel style of pictures or images about dance and sports.</p>

                    <p>The website was actually good in my own experience, I was able to access it easily considering the photos and videos. I was amazed by the details and the objectives like the fact that it doesn't limit just on the website itself but it's even extended to other app to access the files like Google drive, it was informative and understandable. Maybe the only problem that I noticed was the alignment of text on the website reason for its feature to become look spacious. Overall, It was greatly beneficial for different audiences. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who'll need such informations.</p>

                    <p>As a student, MotionLit is a great tool that contains all of the necessary and essential information that students are looking for. This website is interesting and highly informative. Discussions are thoroughly explained so that students can easily understand. What I like the most about this MotionLit website is that they included "Download file here," which allows everyone to download for free the lecture handouts, quizzes, and answer key, making it easier, more convenient, and useful for everyone to assess their knowledge or what they have learned from both dance and sports classes. In terms of the design and color combinations, it is nice and pleasing. However, my only recommendation is that they change or avoid excessive editing of the attached images. To conclude, the MotionLit website performed its functions efficiently and effectively enough that I would highly recommend it to anyone. Thank you so much!</p>
